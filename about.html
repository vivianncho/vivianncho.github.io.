    <p id="me">

      As I joined a <a href="https://lamont.columbia.edu/events/science-saturday-1" style="color:#000">Science Saturday program</a> hosted by the Lamont Doherty earth observatory because of my interest in aquatic animals, I got interested in helping to promote conservation solutions to help the animals. I began interning at the <a href="https://www.greenschoolsalliance.org/home" style="color:#000">Green School Alliance program</a> to help create change and connect schools to lead to a more sustainable future. I acquired information about climate change and its effects. Then I soon branched out into learning more about the influence of climate change on wildlife and got the desire to help them. I want to help inform people about the many marine animals that face the heat of climate change.

  Motivations:
</h2>

<p id="motivationInfo">
I have enjoyed seeing and learning about wildlife since I was young, and  I believe it is unfair that they donâ€™t get to live in their habitat comfortably because of humans and climate change. With the hopes of people learning more and opening their eyes to see the harms climate change has on marine animals, this website was made. I believe that people can help to stop climate change as people have been the cause of it.
